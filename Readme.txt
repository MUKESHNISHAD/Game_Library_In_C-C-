   taking Way For creating this project  if I discuss the time it Takes 1.6 year For deloaping all project But 
   Finally am completed on all project.
==================================================================================================================
Today Am discuss About my C/C++ Programing Project Here i create Some Project in a form of Game.
================================================================================================
How To Know each project Working???
-> Don't panic Am also Declear about perticur project's Deatails and There Working so Don't be panic
-> First You Download Perticuler Project on Your Laptop/Pc
-> intall turboC++ Or DevC++ (With Graphics Feature)
-> Then start it 
================================================================================================
Which tools is Used in this Project??
-> Basically Not Any Tools is used in Project's But it used on C-Program/C++ Program
-> So i can say that Only used on Programing Language.
================================================================================================
Software Requirement ??
1. TurboC++ (Allready install Graphics Feature on TurboC++ Only used header File)
2. DevC++ ( This is vary Populer Software For Programmer But Am recommend With You Please Download TurboC++ Because
            it Graphics SetUp is Very Time Taking Process And Also it vary Hard Process so am recommend With You 
            Please Download TurboC++ For Used Any Project)
=================================================================================================
How to understand Project Layout And there Code ??
-> Am try to code For easy understanding Code Each step is clear (if You check it each-each function how to working)
-> Domain is very importance.
==================================================================================================
How to improve self Efficiency??
-> Practice On You can Write own Code For this project
-> Try to take one-day on one-project
-> Write code Only C/C++
-> Before Write the code First You Design Layout On your Copy 
-> Am some Project it not declear on function but If you Want to improve your Programing skill then you can
   Used Function For any program
-> Functional programing is Very easy to used and understanding for another 
-> How to declear Function - > Return_type Fun(Arg1,Arg2) { return Arg; }
-> The function only perform perticular Task and after perform then Return it.
-> Key Point : Make Rule And follow it untill Death
